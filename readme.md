<h2>Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)</h2>

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

<h2>Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)</h2>

<ol>
<li>date/time</li>
<li>city</li>
<li>state</li>
<li>country</li>
<li>shape</li>
</ol>
